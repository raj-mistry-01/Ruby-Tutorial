methods end by !
when we use a normal method that does not modify the original object or value 
we have to return it or store it into a another var to work on in

to come with this problem bang methods are used
they modify the original object , so we do not need to return or stote it into to a var.

We can say that bang method operatos self in place

in ruby most of every method has bang methos of it
